I currently work as a post-doc at Aalto university with [Samuel Kaski](https://people.aalto.fi/samuel.kaski) and [Arto Klami](https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/persons/arto-klami) on Bayesian frameworks and user feedback.

I received the B.Sc. degree in telecommunication engineering from the Universidad de Granada in 2015. 
I then received the M.Sc. doing two bilingual masters in telecommunications engineering and multimedia and communications from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid in 2017. In 2021, I recieved my Ph.D. from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid in 2021 under the supervision of [Vanessa GÃ³mez Verdejo](http://vanessa.webs.tsc.uc3m.es/). 

My research is focused on Bayesian machine learning and latent models mainly used for health problems. My Ph.D. was centered around using neuroaimaging data for the characteristaion of mental disorders using Bayesian latent models. Since then, I have been exploring different approaches to work with Bayesian variational inference for tasks like working with longituinal data or exploring kernel extentions.
