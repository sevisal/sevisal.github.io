ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we propose a novel Machine Learning Model based on Bayesian Linear Regression intended to deal with the low sample-to-variable ratio typically found in neuroimaging studies and focusing on mental disorders. The proposed model combines feature selection capabilities with a formulation in the dual space which, in turn, enables efficient work with neuroimaging data. Thus, we have tested the proposed algorithm with real MRI data from an animal model of schizophrenia. The results show that our proposal efficiently predicts the diagnosis and, at the same time, detects regions which clearly match brain areas well-known to be related to schizophrenia.},
