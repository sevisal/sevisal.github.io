      <description>Gokarna is an opinionated theme with a focus on minimalism and simplicity.
Content Types This theme supports two types of content types: post and page. To specify them, you need to add them in your markdown metadata.
Post This is the default blog post type which will be shown in your &amp;ldquo;Posts&amp;rdquo; section and who&amp;rsquo;s tags will be indexed. Basically, a normal blog post.

      <title>Bayesian learning of feature spaces for multitasks problems</title>

      <description>This paper presents a Bayesian framework to construct non-linear, parsimonious, shallow models for multitask regression. The proposed framework relies on the approximation of an RBF kernel by a linear combination of Random Fourier Features (RFFs). The main idea is to combine both primal and dual views of the same model under a single Bayesian formulation suited for multitask problems. From the dual point of view (kernel methods), the proposed formulation facilitates the introduction of prior domain knowledge through the RBF kernel parameter.</description>

      <title>Multi-view hierarchical Variational AutoEncoders with Factor Analysis latent space</title>

      <description>Real-world databases are complex and usually require dealing with heterogeneous and mixed data types making the exploitation of shared information between views a critical issue. For this purpose, recent studies based on deep generative models merge all views into a nonlinear complex latent space, which can share information among views. However, this solution limits the model’s interpretability, flexibility, and modularity. We propose a novel method to overcome these limitations by combining multiple Variational AutoEncoders (VAE) with a Factor Analysis latent space (FA-VAE).</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm for Multi-View Feature Selection</title>

      <description>Multi-view datasets offer diverse forms of data that can enhance prediction models by providing complementary information. However, the use of multi-view data leads to an increase in high-dimensional data, which poses significant challenges for the prediction models that can lead to poor generalization. Therefore, relevant feature selection from multi-view datasets is important as it not only addresses the poor generalization but also enhances the interpretability of the models. Despite the success of traditional feature selection methods, they have limitations in leveraging intrinsic information across modalities, lacking generalizability, and being tailored to specific classification tasks.</description>

      <description>Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-Of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a reference method for microbial identification and it can be used to predict Antibiotic Resistance (AR) when combined with artificial intelligence methods. However, current solutions need time-costly preprocessing steps, are difficult to reproduce due to hyperparameter tuning, are hardly interpretable, and do not pay attention to epidemiological differences inherent to data coming from different centres, which can be critical.
We propose using a multi-view heterogeneous Bayesian model (KSSHIBA) for the prediction of AR using MALDI-TOF MS data together with their epidemiological differences.</description>

      <title>Multi-task longitudinal forecasting with missing values on Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

      <description>Background and Objective:Machine learning techniques typically used in dementia assessment are not able to learn multiple tasks jointly and deal with time-dependent heterogeneous data containing missing values. In this paper, we reformulate SSHIBA, a recently introduced Bayesian multi-view latent variable model, for jointly learning diagnosis, ventricle volume, and ADAS score in dementia on longitudinal data with missing values.
Methods:We propose a novel Bayesian Variational inference framework capable of simultaneously imputing missing values and combining information from several views.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Sparse Factor Analysis with Kernelized Observations</title>

      <description>Multi-view problems can benefit from latent representations since they find low-dimensional projections that fairly capture the correlations among the multiple views that characterise the data. On the other hand, high-dimensionality and non-linear issues are traditionally handled by kernel methods, inducing a (non)-linear function between the latent projection and the data itself. However, they usually come with exposition to overfitting. Here, we combine Bayesian factor analysis with what we refer to as kernelized observations, in which the proposed model focuses on reconstructing not the data itself, but its relationship with other data points measured by a kernel function.</description>

      <title>A Novel Bayesian Linear Regression Model for the Analysis of Neuroimaging Data</title>
      <link>https://carlos.sevillasalcedo.org/publications/2022.blr-fs/</link>

      <guid>https://carlos.sevillasalcedo.org/publications/2022.blr-fs/</guid>
      <description>In this paper, we propose a novel Machine Learning Model based on Bayesian Linear Regression intended to deal with the low sample-to-variable ratio typically found in neuroimaging studies and focusing on mental disorders. The proposed model combines feature selection capabilities with a formulation in the dual space which, in turn, enables efficient work with neuroimaging data. Thus, we have tested the proposed algorithm with real MRI data from an animal model of schizophrenia.</description>

      <description>The Bayesian approach to feature extraction, known as factor analysis (FA), has been widely studied in machine learning to obtain a latent representation of the data. An adequate selection of the probabilities and priors of these bayesian models allows the model to better adapt to the data nature (i.e. heterogeneity, sparsity), obtaining a more representative latent space.
The objective of this article is to propose a general FA framework capable of modelling any problem.</description>

      <description>Emoji can be enabled in a Hugo project in a number of ways.
The emojify function can be called directly in templates or Inline Shortcodes.
To enable emoji globally, set enableEmoji to true in your site configuration and then you can type emoji shorthand codes directly in content files.
These begin and end with a colon and include the code of an emoji:

      <title>Regularized Bagged Canonical Component Analysis for Multiclass Learning in Brain Imaging</title>
      <link>https://carlos.sevillasalcedo.org/publications/2020.baggingcca/</link>

      <description>A fundamental problem of supervised learning algorithms for brain imaging applications is that the number of features far exceeds the number of subjects. In this paper, we propose a combined feature selection and extraction approach for multiclass problems. This method starts with a bagging procedure which calculates the sign consistency of the multivariate analysis (MVA) projection matrix feature-wise to determine the relevance of each feature. This relevance measure provides a parsimonious matrix, which is combined with a hypothesis test to automatically determine the number of selected features.</description>

      <description>History Blüdhaven was a former whaling town, which was officially incorporated as a &amp;ldquo;Commonwealth&amp;rdquo; in 1912. The town had a generally poor socio-economic populace, owing in part to failed efforts to transform itself into a manufacturing and shipping center.</description>
